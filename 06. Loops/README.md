06. Loops
======

01. Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to N.

02. Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to N, that are not divisible by 3 and 7 at the same time.

03. Write a program that reads from the console a sequence of N integer numbers and returns the minimal and maximal of them.

04. Write a program that calculates N!/K! for given N and K (1<K<N).

05. Write a program that calculates N!*K! / (K-N)! for given N and K (1<N<K).

06. Write a program that, for a given two integer numbers N and X, calculates the sumS = 1 + 1!/X + 2!/X2 + … + N!/XN

07. Write a program that reads a number N and calculates the sum of the first N members of the sequence of Fibonacci: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, … Each member of the Fibonacci sequence (except the              first two) is a sum of the previous two members.

08. Write a program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of given two numbers.

09. In the combinatorial mathematics, the Catalan numbers are calculated by the following formula: (2*n)! / (n + 1)! * n! 
10. Write a program to calculate the Nth Catalan number by given N.

11. Write a program that prints all possible cards from a standard deck of 52 cards (without jokers). The cards should be printed with their English names. Use nested for loops and switch-case.

12. Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer number N (N < 20) and outputs a matrix.

13. Write a program that calculates for given N how many trailing zeros present at the end of the number N!.

14. Write a program that reads a positive integer number N (N < 20) from console and outputs in the console the numbers 1 ... N numbers arranged as a spiral.
